                    <p>
                        Growing up, I've always wanted to be a techie. And now as a front end web developer, my goal is to complete worthy projects, and be the best in my field.
                        Although, I'm not design-inclined (at least I don't think I can design amazing UIs) I can definitely implement any design given to me using html and CSS. 
                        <br>
                        I have intermediate proficiency in html, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript technologies. But only a basic proficiency with react.
                        <br>
                        As a developer with limited experience I hope to gather as much experience as I can, and test my limits with the HNG internship.
                        I will try my best to complete all tasks to the best of my ability.
